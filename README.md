# `nimSconeCompiler`
Minimal implementation of the Scone language's compiler, implemented in the
Nim language.

This version of the compiler is intended to be used for implementing a
non-minimal version of the language's compiler in Scone itself.

And remember:
> It's a scone, Luigi. You didn't bake it.
